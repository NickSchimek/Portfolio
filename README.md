### Sept. 17, 2017 - My first open source contribution.

Increase the contrast of the font for the main body

Changed the font color for the main body to match the font color of the headings
to improve contrast.

Poor contrast decreases readability. I used the color contrast check at:
https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html to test the chosen color
is compliant. The old color #777 was failing at 4.5 and the new color #222 is
passing at 16.0.
